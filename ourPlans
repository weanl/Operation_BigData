	1, general model for the 50 DataBase
	2, analysis of the Feature Selection
	3, fewer features for regression and classification
	4, try the sequency model LSTM

The Report Struct:
	Part 1:
		 different distribution of features in corresponding DBIDs

		 Give the picture of the specific LoadScore and PerfScore
		 Then, by the FS-method, MIC, we can compare the Score with the chosen features. 
		 	LoadScore: DBID = 2031853600 MIC choose "2080031" as the most import one.
		 	PerfScore: DBID = 1227435885 (1) choose "2080049" as the most import one.
